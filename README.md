Binary Search

The binSrch.py file contains an implementation of the binary search algorithim. In the file I a have implemented a class BinarySearch 
that inherits from list and allows for searching of an element using the binary search algorithim. Two parameters are required to
instanciate a BinarySearch: a parameter that specifies the length of the list to be created and a parameter that describes the 
intervals between elements of the list. It is also important to note only numeric types are supported.

Missing Number

The findMiss.py file contains an implementation of function that accepts two list as it's arguments and returns the elemnt that is not
present in both of the lists.

HTML and CSS

The lab.html and main.css are used to create a simple HTML interface for capturing a students  details. To see interface, just place
both files on the same location and double click on the labs.html to open it on your browser.

This labs are part of the Andela Boot Camp programming exercises.
