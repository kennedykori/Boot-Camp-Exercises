# Boot-Camp-Exercises
For this question, I created a domain model about cats. The cat species can easily be used to demonstrate OOP concecpts such as 
polymorphism, inheritance and encapsulation easily. For instance, the great cats such as lions, tigers and jaguars are able to 
roar and smaller cats can purr. Also a house (domestic) cat is able to meow.

The OOPLab.py file can be run as a python script to demonstrate the OOP concepts mentioned above.
